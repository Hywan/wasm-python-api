# WebAssembly Python API

This is a draft, a Work In Progress.

## Design Goals

## Interfaces

The Python API is implemented as a set of abstract classes, that can
be found in the `webassembly/` directory.

## Usage

These abstract classes can be used to instantiate concrete classes by following
the existing standard-to-be interface. See examples in `examples/` and `tests/`.
